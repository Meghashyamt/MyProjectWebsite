## My Worked Projects

One of the most common confusions arises among the modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, data science, deep learning and more. While they are all closely interconnected, each has a distinct purpose and functionality. Over the past few years, the popularity of these technologies has risen to such an extent that several companies have now woken up to their importance on massive levels and are increasingly looking to implement them for their business growth.

However, among aspirants, there seem to be clouds of misconceptions surrounding these various technologies.

## Projects

### House Price -Linear Regression
A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.

### Import Kaggle Data
Struggling to work on large datasets in Kaggle to notebooks, here the required code you can work on easily
 
```
Easy Steps to persist Kaggle profile

Download kaggle.json from Kaggle -- MyAccount -- Create New API Token - auto downloads as "kaggle.json

Import json into notebook - run in a cell from google.colab import files files.upload()

Browse to downloaded kaggle.json and upload Setup Kaggle DIR; copy json file ; chmod !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/ !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json !ls ~/.kaggle

Verify json content !ls -l ~/.kaggle !cat ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

Install kaggle packages !pip install -q kaggle !pip install -q kaggle-cli

List Kaggle DataSets !kaggle datasets list
